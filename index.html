<h3>Discrete Fourier Transform Visualization</h3>
The green/blue circles in the lower window represent a 2D signal over time, a signal which is determined by the values in the frequency domain, which can be adjusted by the user.</br></br>
The buttons in the top window pane represent frequencies: the little 'W' value indicates it's angular velocity, and the bar above it indicates it's magnitude.</br></br>
<b>Click the orange buttons</b> to show/hide the red hands in the lower pane.</br>
<b>Drag the red hands</b> to alter the corresponding frequency.</br>
